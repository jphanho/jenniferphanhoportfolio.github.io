				<h1>Shioriko in the Anime</h1>

			<div class="paragraph">
				<p>
					In the anime, Shioriko had always longed to be a school idol when her older sister, Kaoruko, introduced them to her when she was young as she was one herself. Kaoruko would often invite Shioriko to practice with her and she became more enamored with them deepened as time went by.
				</p>
				<p>
					Those days eventually came to an end though as Kaoruko graduated and her days as a school idol were over. In the end, she was unable to fulfill her dream as one of winning the national school idol competition, the Love Live. Shioriko was deeply wounded by her sister's failure and vowed to not make the same mistake, causing her to stay in her lane and stick to what she knew she was good at.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, despite this, she still badly wanted to be a school idol as she watched the school idol club and her best friend, Lanzhu's, activities. Those feelings eventually reached a boiling point when the members of the school idol club found out about her wish and urged her to join them. It wasn't until Kaoruko told her that while she was dissapointed, she doesn't regret the time she spent as a school idol that Shioriko was finally able to move forward and fulfill her dream.

			<div class="paragraph">
				<p>
					Similar to the anime, Shioriko's perception of dreams was jaded due to her sister's failure. However, she was introduced as a rival character. She was initially much more aggressive in her belief that dreams were worthless and felt disdain towards school idols as a whole, wanting to disband the school idol club to save the members from the same dissapointment her sister faced.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, after watching the tireless efforts of the members of the school idol club, her resolve began to weaken. Eventually, their conviction and joy in being school idols despite failure caused her to concede and join the club.
