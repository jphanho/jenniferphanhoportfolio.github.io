				<p>"Thousands of eyes were waiting for the birth of a new diva. But I just loved songs and enjoyed singing them... So could I really give them what they wanted? There's no worth in a girl from the Taylor Family who can't sing." - Anime</p>

				<p>"You don't know the pressures of being part of the Taylor family. The world came to love us through music, and they expect music from us! [...] If I had just been able to sing with pride, I'm sure they would've accepted me as another star... But I couldn't." - SIFAS</p>

				<h1>Who is Mia Taylor?</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="paragraph">
				Mia Taylor is a third year transfer student from New York. Back in the States, she skipped many grades and was a college student before coming to Japan and repeating a grade. She is part of the prestigious Taylor music family and is a prodigy in composing, already becoming a world renowned composer at fourteen.

				<h1>Mia in the Anime</h1>

			<div class="paragraph">
				<p>
					In the anime, Mia enrolled in Nijigasaki alongside Lanzhu as business partners in which Mia would compose music for Lanzhu to perform. This arrangement would serve to be beneficial for the both of them until Lanzhu decided to quit being a school idol and return to Hong Kong.
				</p>
				<p>
					At first, Mia was frustrated and blamed herself for not being able to make adequate songs for Lanzhu and vowed to create the perfect song for her. However, the issue wasn't with Mia's songs but with Lanzhu herself which left Mia at a loss as to what to do.
				</p>
				<p>
					Later on, when Mia confides in one of the members of the school idol club, Rina, she reveals why she's so desperate for Lanzhu to sing her songs. Back when she was a child, Mia always loved singing. However, when it was time for her to debut as a singer, the pressure of upholding the Taylor name with nothing but her measly love for music crushed her and she wasn't able to sing. Mia became a composer in order to still stay connected to music in some way. She valued her partnership with Lanzhu because she thought she would be able to achieve her dream through her. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Through her conversation with Rina, Mia realized that she and Lanzhu were more similar than she initially thought: The both of them were in pursuit of what they thought was an unattainable dream. This caused her to have a breakthrough and compose a new song from her to Lanzhu that told her she wasn't alone, "stars we chase".

			<div class="paragraph">
				<p>
					Mia's core arc in SIFAS remains largely unchanged from the anime. However, it was revealed that Mia hated music for a time because of her family name but couldn't bring herself to truly hate it because of how much she loved it. The reason why Mia was fixated on Lanzhu's performance in particular was also stated, where Lanzhu was able to sing any and every song proudly, something Mia wanted to do too.
