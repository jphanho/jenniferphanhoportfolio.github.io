				<p>"I love it when others have so much fun. And I love having fun myself! Becoming school idols that can understand that fun and excitement together, if we can do that, I can finally run down that uncharted path! A path filled with so many unknowns!" - Anime</p>

				<p>I obviously respect and love everyone in the Club, so I'm happy if any of them win and I'm genuinely happy for them. But now, it's kinda different. I wanna win. I want to take them on in a serious battle and win." - SIFAS</p>

			<div class="paragraph">
				<p>
					In the anime, Ai often looked for new activities to do for the sake of having fun and once she had her fill, would move on to the next activity. Ai initially temporarily became a school idol for that very reason: Because it seemed fun for both her and for the people who would watch her. As she spent time as an idol, she was enamored by the other members who were unlike anyone she's met before and kept experiencing new heart pounding and challenging experiences, causing her to fall in love with being a school idol and staying as a permanent member.

				<h1>Ai in SIFAS</h1>

			<div class="paragraph">
				<p>
					In SIFAS, Ai's feelings towards being a school idol is further expanded on in season two of the main story where all the club members face off against each other on stage in a battle of the bands type of situation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Her feelings evolve from only wanting to have fun to becoming more serious in giving everything she has to excel as a school idol. She wanted to prove her growth as one by competing with her fellow club members and coming out on top.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ai particularly admires and wanted to face the most talented member of the club, Setsuna Yuki. When the two finally faced off against each other, it ended in Ai's defeat.
				</p>
				<p>
					While she was frustrated to tears, it only reaffirmed her growing feelings of how important being a school idol has truly become to her if it was able to make her feel such a wide range of both positive and negative emotions despite being something she loves.
