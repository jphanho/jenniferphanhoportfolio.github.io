				<h1>Who is Lanzhu Zhong?</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="paragraph">
				<p>
					Lanzhu is a second year transfer student from Hong Kong. She is considered to be perfect and excels in everything she does. However, due to her ambition of wanting to be the best, unyielding attitude, and candid way of speaking, Lanzhu often comes across as arrogant and callous to others. She was first introduced as a rival character to the school idol club before eventually joining herself.

				<h1>Lanzhu in the Anime</h1>

			<div class="paragraph">
				<p>
					In the anime, Lanzhu initially refused to join the club because of a difference in ideals. She believed that the relationship between idols and fans were purely transactional, where idols would inspire and give dreams to the audience and only recieve their love and adoration in return. Meanwhile the members of the school idol club believed that the relationship between the two was based on a mutual bond of wanting to achieve a shared dream.
				</p>
				<p>
					Later on when Lanzhu and the members of the school idol club faced off against each other on stage with the club winning did she realize that the club's beliefs were more accurate to succeeding as an idol. Because of this, she decided to quit being one and return to Hong Kong.
				</p>
				<p>
					When Shioriko and the club went to stop Lanzhu, it was revealed that Lanzhu only rejected the club's ideology because she couldn't hold long lasting relationships based solely on mutual affection as a result of her difficult personality. That was why she only believed in transactional relationships where both sides would stay with each other as long as there was a benefit to it.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the end, they were able to put their differences aside and Lanzhu was accepted into the school idol club where she would continue striving to be the top school idol along with her new friends.

				<h1>Lanzhu in SIFAS</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="paragraph">
				<p>
					In SIFAS, Lanzhu initially refused to join the club because she wanted to create a better environment for the school idol club to take their skills to the next level. Unlike in the anime, Lanzhu's purpose was to become friends with the school idol club by showing how much they can benefit by being with her.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, this only partially succeeds as only a portion of the club members, Karin, Ai, and Shioriko, join her. The remaining members who didn't join were immensely put off by Lanzhu's downright forceful and pushy behavior and kept rejecting her advances to befriend them, thinking that she was being condescending.
				</p>
				<p>
					Her good intentions were only recognized after being rejected by her best friend, Shioriko, and deciding to quit being a school idol and return to her old life in Hong Kong. Before she could, the club members caught her and they mutually apologized to each other before Lanzhu officially joined their club.
