				<h1>Who is Kasumi Nakasu?</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="paragraph">
				<p>
					Kasumi is a first year student at Nijigasaki high school. Her motivation for being a school idol is that it's a means for her to express her desire to be the "cutest in the whole world" and allow her cuteness to bring happiness to others in the form of wearing cute costumes, singing cute songs, and putting on an overall cute performance. Although she can be mischievious, she dearly loves her friends in the school idol club and is earnest in her efforts in improving herself despite her lack of talent.

				<h1>Kasumi in the Anime</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="paragraph">
				<p>
					In the anime, Kasumi's role is primarily establishing the school idol club. After having a falling out with the previous club president of the initial school idol club, Setsuna Yuki, the group disbands due to a conflict in creative direction where each member wanted to be a different kind of idol with Setsuna's passionate vision and Kasumi's cute vision clashing the most. 
				</p>
				<p>
					However, she couldn't let her dream end before it started and re-established the club. As the new club president, Kasumi continued their club activities with the new members, Ayumu Uehara and Yu Takasaki, until she and the original members of the school idol club came to an understanding. The club would live on with each member becoming their own individual solo idol rather than operate as a single group.

				<h1>Kasumi in SIFAS</h1>

			<div class="paragraph">
				<p>
					In SIFAS, Kasumi as an individual character is given more time to shine, primarily in her bond story where we see more closely her journey as an idol.
				</p>
				<p>
					Kasumi is considered to be the least talented out of all the club members by others as well as being aware of it herself. Despite this, she stubbornly refuses to be left in the dust and makes up for their differences through tireless effort, often being one of the last ones to go home from practice.
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite this, Kasumi still fails over and over again, getting back up each time. It wasn't until a performance showing her vulnerabilities and expressing her genuine gratitude to the few people that do acknowledge her as a wonderful idol does she finally have her efforts recognized.
				</p>
				<p>
					Kasumi's bond story caused her popularity to sky-rocket, causing her win a fan voting of who would get a new original song complete with a music video, "Muteki-kyuu*Believer", or "Invincible*Believer".
