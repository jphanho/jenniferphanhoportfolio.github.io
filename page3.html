				<h1>Who is Karin Asaka?</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="paragraph">
				<p>
					Karin is a third year student at Nijigasaki high school. While she was initially hesitant to join the school idol club due to her competitive and ambitious spirit causing conflict working with others in the past, their emphasis on individuality and inspiring each other to reach greater heights won her over. Karin also works as an amateur model and uses her experience as a model and an idol to enhance her performance in both areas.

				<h1>Karin in the Anime</h1>

			<div class="paragraph">
				<p>
					In the anime, the school idol club is approached with the opportunity to perform at a decently popular music festival in the area. However, since everyone is a solo idol, an issue arised on who was going to perform as a representative of their school. While everyone wanted to perform, they didn't want to cause conflict with each other. This is when Karin stepped up, cutting straight to the point and asserting that they need to stop meandering otherwise they wouldn't be able to rise to this challenge properly.
				</p>
				<p>
					Karin's words resonated with everyone in the club and after reflecting, they later elected Karin to be their representative. While she accepted their decision, on the day of the festival, the pressure got to her and she thought of herself as pathetic for talking so big only to crumble last second.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, the rest of the club members reassured her and believed full heartedly that she would be able to give a performance that they would all be proud of as a representative of their club, calming her nerves and allowing her to steal the gazes of everyone in the audience.

				<h1>Karin in SIFAS</h1>

			<div class="paragraph">
				<p>
					In SIFAS, Karin's competitive spirit is further expanded on. In her bond story, she reveals that she used to be a lot more passionate about modeling but that changed when she was presented with an opportunity of a more major shoot alongside other models. Karin thought that they were equally passionate as her about this chance and urged them to go above and beyond to give it their all, but that only caused conflict in the group. It eventually ended with Karin being kicked off the project, causing her to stifle her passion until it was reignited once more as her days as a school idol continued.
				</p>
				<p>
					In season two of the main story where all the club members face off and compete against each other on stage, Karin was set on coming out on top. However, she lost to Kasumi by an overwhelming margin, frustrating her beyond belief. She threw everything she had cultivated on that stage yet she still lost so soundly. While it was a painful experience, it further motivated her to continue improving so that she can never feel that way again.
